# PortlandMetroCyberLab
This project will contain some of the configutation files as well as the custom rules that I have created for the OIT Portland Metro cybersecurity lab.
This will include a docker compose for Graylog, Nxlog configuratuions, and possibly copies of virtual machines - or their templates - for future reference.
Labs will be developed with input from departmental stakeholders, and may be considered for use in teaching future MIS 351 as well as CYB 301-303 classes.

These labs will reference the VMs required to run them. I have access to a proxmox environment which simplifies things for me, but these labs can be run inside of vmware, virtualbox or HyperV.
I will make good faith efforts to document systems and services installed on each VM so that they can be replicated in different environemnts if needed.
